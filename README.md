# ASP.NET Core Single Page App templates

This repo is home for the ASP.NET Core Single Page Application (SPA) project templates that ship as part of the .NET SDK for Angular and React, as well as a listing of community provided templates for using ASP.NET Core with other frontend JavaScript frameworks.

The templates in this repo establish a pattern that can be replicated for using ASP.NET Core with other frontend JavaScript frameworks. Check out the [ASP.NET Core docs](https://aka.ms/aspnetcorespa) for details on integrating ASP.NET Core with frontend JavaScript frameworks.

We try to keep the list of community owned SPA project templates up to date as well as want to make sure it is a good quality list for everyone to refer to. For that, submissions will be evaluated by our team on case-by-case basis.

## How to propose a new SPA project template reference

We've created a new PR template, to help with new project template proposals.
The format of each project template in the file should follow existing pattern, which goes as follows:

```
1. **Template name** / [GitHub](https://github.com/**owner/repo**) /  [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/**packageName**/)<br />
  Short description of the template
```

Simply copy the above template to the bottom of this file, and then modify it as necessary.

When you're ready to propose your changes prepared in your fork, use the `/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/projectTemplate.md` PR template when submitting a new PR. To do so, append the additional `&template=projectTemplate.md` parameter to the PR creation page link, and you'll get all the info we need to fill in for the PR.
