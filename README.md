# ASP.NET Core Single Page App templates

This repo is home for the ASP.NET Core Single Page Application (SPA) project templates that ship as part of the .NET SDK for Angular and React, as well as a listing of community provided templates for using ASP.NET Core with other frontend JavaScript frameworks.

The templates in this repo establish a pattern that can be replicated for using ASP.NET Core with other frontend JavaScript frameworks. Check out the [ASP.NET Core docs](https://aka.ms/aspnetcorespa) for details on integrating ASP.NET Core with frontend JavaScript frameworks.
